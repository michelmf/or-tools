# OR-Tools - Assignment

Assignment for the Linear Programming class @ CEFET/PPCIC. This assignment aims to present a numerical solver and how to use it to tackle small and medium-size problems.

## About OR-Tools

From the official [website](https://developers.google.com/optimization): 

> OR-Tools is an open-source software suite for optimization, tuned for tackling the world's most challenging problems in vehicle routing, flows, integer and linear programming, and constraint programming.
>
> After modeling your problem in the programming language of your choice, you can use a half dozen solvers to solve it: commercial solvers such as Gurobi or CPLEX, or open-source solvers such as SCIP, GLPK, or Google's GLOP and award-winning CP-SAT.

This repo contains some examples of using OR-Tools with Python Programming Language.

## How to install OR-Tools

OR-Tools is available in different programming languages such as C++, Python, Java, and C#. In this assignment, I am focusing on the Python programming language. Getting the package is straightforward using pip:

> python -m pip install --upgrade --user ortools
